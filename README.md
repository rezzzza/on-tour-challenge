# On Tour Challenge
[On Tour](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/251412/on-tour) is a [roll-and-write](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/213815/roll-and-write-games) and Network-building board game.
Players use two D-10 dice rolls and three random selected location cards to plan their music band's travel and get them to as many states as possible during a 100-day tour.

It's a code challenge to create a _Perfect Player_! We are trying to write an agent that detects the best move in each turn and achieves the highest possible score.
